If moving a card, it must be from one player's hand (without peeking) to another or to the top of the appropriate discard pile, or from the top of a discard pile to a player's hand.

They may not touch their cards or discuss, gesture, or communicate with each other in any way. Before time runs out, any one of those players, on a first-come, first-serve<span style="color: #999999;">d</span> basis, may claim that you moved one ship, one card, both, or neither, and must identify either the source or destination for each move.

The "if any" clause is puzzling. If it is trying to say "if there are any captured ships" then it is unnecessary, because if the flare was used then there will be captured ships. On the other hand, if it is trying to say "if their owners have any colonies" then it is starting a job it doesn't finish since it does not define what we should do if one or more owners do not have any colonies. This situation (like dozens of others) simply defaults to the <i>general rule</i> that if you are supposed to return ships to colonies and have none, you send your ships to the warp. In either case, the "if any" clause is neither necessary nor helpful.<br/>

<b>Edited</b> to eliminate significant excess verbiage, for readability, for wording consistency, to clarify interactions with game effects like <span style="background-color: #DDDDDD;">Anti-Matter</span> and <span style="background-color: #DDDDDD;">Virus</span>, to add missing timing indicators on base power and Super Macron, to fix Wild Macron's <span style="background-color: #DDDDDD;">main player bug</span>, to fix Super Macron's <span style="background-color: #DDDDDD;">launch bug</span> and <span style="background-color: #DDDDDD;">defensive ally bug</span>, and for terminology. Macron's revision history is a bit complicated. In pre-release marketing, FFG previewed a version on their website that said, in part, "When you are a main player or ally, <b>
<i>use</i>
</b> this power after allies are invited. If you are the offense or an ally, you may only send one ship into the encounter." Players pointed out that this <b>
<i>use</i>
</b> of the power (in the Alliance phase) came too late to restrict the offense to just one ship in the gate. FFG changed the card prior to printing, revising the text to distinguish between the offense and non-offense players and adding a <span style="color: orange;">(<u>
<span style="color: black;">Launch</span>
</u>)</span> icon to the alien sheet (but forgetting to include <span style="color: orange;">(<u>
<span style="color: black;">Alliance</span>
</u>)</span> on the Super flare). The printed version queued up the 4x ship value in the launch or alliance phase and did not require the power to be further <b>
<i>used</i>
</b> when encounter totals were being calculated. In the FAQ, they revised Macron again so that the power was <b>
<i>used</i>
</b> again "after cards are revealed," allowing Macron to be zapped to reset its ship value to 1. However, they mysteriously deleted the word "ships" from the first sentence and forgot to add the necessary <span style="color: orange;">(<u>
<span style="color: black;">Reveal</span>
</u>)</span> icon. In the second printing, FFG used the FAQ errata and restored the word "ships," but still missed the icons on both the alien sheet and the flare. The clarified version here corrects those errors and eliminates unnecessary redundancy.<br/>

Quickly relieving the visitors of every last item of value, the Edificabi â€“ by now reduced to little more than squabbling Pickpockets â€“ saw their chance at a better future.
