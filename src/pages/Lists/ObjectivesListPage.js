      <p className="text-light">Objectives are an official variant introduced in Cosmic Odyssey. It is intended primarially with use in the Campaign Mode but can be used as a standalone variant as well. The variant adds an objectives deck, with 4 objectives drawn at the start of the game. At the end of the game, the winner is not the first player to 5 foreign colonies (although that is how the game ends), but the player who scores the most points.

        Cosmic Odyssey introduced 16 objective cards.</p>
