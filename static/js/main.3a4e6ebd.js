Macron\'s revision history is a bit complicated. In pre-release marketing, FFG previewed a version on their website that said, in part, \\"When you are a main player or ally, use this power after allies are invited. If you are the offense or an ally, you may only send one ship into the encounter.\\" Players pointed out that this use of the power (in the Alliance phase) came too late to restrict the offense to just one ship in the gate. FFG changed the card prior to printing, revising the text to distinguish between the offense and non-offense players and adding a Launch icon to the alien sheet (but forgetting to include Alliance on the Super flare). The printed version queued up the 4x ship value in the launch or alliance phase and did not require the power to be further used when encounter totals were being calculated. In the FAQ, they revised Macron again so that the power was used again \\"after cards are revealed,\\" allowing Macron to be zapped to reset its ship value to 1. However, they mysteriously deleted the word \\"ships\\" from the first sentence and forgot to add the necessary Reveal icon. In the second printing, FFG used the FAQ errata and restored the word \\"ships,\\" but still missed the icons on both the alien sheet and the flare. The clarified version here corrects those errors and eliminates unnecessary redundancy.","expansion":"Base Set","designers":["designed by Future Pastimes"],"thumbnail":"avatar_Macron.png"}},"97":{"original":{"name":"Magician","alert":"Red","short":"Steals Card, Confounds Opponent","gameSetup":"","powerName":"You have the power of Prestidigitation.","powerBody":"As a main player, use this power before encounter cards are selected to force your opponent to play two encounter cards facedown.
