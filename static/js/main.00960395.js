If you are the offense or an ally, you may only send one ship into the encounter.\\" Players pointed out that this use of the power (in the Alliance phase) came too late to restrict the offense to just one ship in the gate. FFG changed the card prior to printing, revising the text to distinguish between the offense and non-offense players and adding a Launch icon to the alien sheet (but forgetting to include Alliance on the Super flare). The printed version queued up the 4x ship value in the launch or alliance phase and did not require the power to be further used when encounter totals were being calculated. In the FAQ, they revised Macron again so that the power was used again \\"after cards are revealed,\\" allowing Macron to be zapped to reset its ship value to 1.
